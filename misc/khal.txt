DESCRIPTION
-----------
khal(1) is a standards based command line calendar program. It uses 'vdir'
for calendar storage. 'vdir' can be synced with CalDAV servers via
vdirsyncer(1). khal allows editing, deleting and adding of events to your
calendars.



OPTIONS
-------

*-c*='CONFIG'::
    Use the configuration file 'CONFIG', otherwise *khal(1)* will look in
    '$HOME/.khal/' and '$HOME/.config/khal/' for files named 'khal.conf'.
*-v*::
     Be extra verbose.
*-h, --help*::
     Print a short help text and exit.
*--version*::
    Print khal's version number and exit.
*-a*='NAME'::
    Use the calendar 'NAME' (this option can be used more than
    once with most commands).
*-d*='NAME'::
    Do not use the calendar 'NAME' (this option can be used more than once
    with most commands).


COMMANDS
--------

Khal is divided into several commands which are called as *khal COMMAND*. See
below for a description of the seperate commands.  If you call *khal* without
any commands the default command will be executed (can be configured in the
configuration file).

agenda
~~~~~~
Show all events scheduled for today and tommorow.

calendar
~~~~~~~~
Show a calendar of the current and next two months and all events scheduled for
today and tomorrow.

interactive
~~~~~~~~~~~
Opens khal's interactive mode. Use the arrow keys to navigate in the calendar.
Press 'Tab' or 'Enter' to move the focus into the events column and Left arrow
to return the focus to the calendar area. You can navi‚Äê gate the events column
with the Up and Down arrows and view an event via pressing Enter d will delete
an event (a D will appear in front of the events description, or RO if you
cannot delete that event). Pressing d again will undelete that event.

When viewing an event's details, pressing Enter again will open the
currently selected event in a simple event editor; you can navigate
with the arrow keys again. As long as the event has not been edited you
can leave the editor with pressing Escape Cancel button and press the
Enter key to discard your edits or press the Save button to save your
edits (and upload them on the next sync).

While the calendar area is focused, pressing n will add a new event on
the currently selected date.

*ikhal* is a shortcut for 'khal interactive'.

new
~~~
Add a new event. 'new' supports the following syntax:
'khal new [-a CALENDAR] startdatetime [enddatetime] [timezone] summary [:: longdescription]'

'startdatetime' and 'enddatetime' must be either dates, times or datetimes in
the format configured in the configuration file.

'startdatetime' is a date:
an all day event will be created, if 'enddatetime' is not given, the event will
last for one day.

'startdatetime' is a datetime:
the event will start at 'startdatetime' and end at 'enddatetime'. If no
'enddatetime' is given, the event will last one hour. If 'enddatetime' is a
time, the event will end at that time on the day it starts unless that would
make it end before it starts in which case it will end at that time at the next
day.

'startdatetime' is a time:
the event will start today at time and end at 'enddatetime'. If 'enddatetime'
is a time it will also end today at that time, unless that would make it end
before it starts in which case it will end at that time tomorrow.

The newly created event will be in 'timezone' if given (must be in the Olson DB
format, e.g. 'Europe/Berlin'), if 'timezone' is not given, the 'local timezone'
as configured in the configuration file will be used. It is currently not
possible to create events that start and end in different timezones.

The leftover arguments (up to '::') will be used as the summary of the event.
Everything after '::' will be treated used as the event's description.

If no calendar is specified via '-a CALENDAR' the event will be added to the
default calendar.

printcalendars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Print a list of all configured calendars.
