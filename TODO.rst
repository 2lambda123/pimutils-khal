TODO
====
* colored events (by icalendar)
* recurrent events don't know their real start and end dates
* ikhal: new weeks should be loaded into the walker
* ikhal: editable events
* events that continue over 00:00 get displayed to start on both days
  (confusing)


DONE
====
* events should be sorted
* khal should show tomorrows events, too
* ikhal should start with today focused
* output times are NOT localized yet
