Installation
------------
You can install *khal* from source by executing *python setup.py install*.

Copy and edit the supplied khal.conf.sample file (default location is
~/.config/khal/khal.conf).

Make sure you have sqlite3 (normally available by default), icalendar_, urwid
(>0.9) and pyxdg installed.

khal has so far been successfully tested on recent versions of FreeBSD,
NetBSD, Debian and Ubuntu with python 2.7.
