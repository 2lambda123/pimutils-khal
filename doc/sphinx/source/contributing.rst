Contributing to khal
====================

Submitting a Bug
----------------

If you found a bug or any part of khal isn't working as you
expected, please check if that bug is either already reported at 

https://github.com/geier/khal/issues?state=open

If it isn't, always run the command again with the -v option
and paste the output of that (of course you can edit out any private
details like your username and resource). 



Hacking
-------

If you want to hack on khal and have some questions, please don't
hesitate to contact me, I will gladly provide you with any information
you need. If you want to implement some larger features, it's probably
best to contact me first and see if me or somebody else is already
working on it.

Before submitting your first patch, please add yourself to
*CONTRIBUTORS.txt*.

You can submit patches either via email (khal at lostpackets dot de) or
via github pull requests.
