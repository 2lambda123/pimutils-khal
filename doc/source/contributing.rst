Feedback and Contributing to khal
=================================

The prefered way of interaction with *khal*'s developer is via github_. But if
you do not feel comfortable using github, please don't hesitate to contact me
via email (khal at lostpackets dot de) or via jabber/XMPP (geier at jabber dot
ccc dot de).

Feedback
--------
Please do provide feedback if *khal* works for you or even more importantly
if it doesn't. Feature requests and other ideas on how to improve khal are also
welcome.

Submitting a Bug
----------------
If you found a bug or any part of khal isn't working as you
expected, please check if that bug is either already reported at

https://github.com/geier/khal/issues?state=open

If it isn't, always run the command again with the -v option
and paste the output of that (of course you can edit out any private
details like your username and resource).


Hacking
-------
If you want to hack on khal and have some questions, please don't hesitate to
contact me, I will gladly provide you with any information you need. If you want
to implement some larger features, it's probably best to contact me first and
see if me or somebody else is already working on it.

Before submitting your first patch, please add yourself to *CONTRIBUTORS.txt*.


You can submit patches either via github pull requests (the prefered method) or
via email (khal at lostpackets dot de).
